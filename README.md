# Event Driven Programming Final Project
### Typing Game: Spellchant Typer

a (usually group but)Solo Project by **Kristian Ragonton** made purely with Javascript.

Tested working for Google Chrome Browser, likely to be incompatible with other browsers (firefox in particular produces errors) 

more information in "Spell Chant Typer Docs.docx"

Begin the game by opening "Spell Chant Typer.html" this is a required step to initialize the **pseudo-database**(via localstorage JSON)

"spell_test_page.html", "spell_effects_test_page.html", and "misc_test_page.html" represent and display the **pseudo-databases**
